# GitHub Practice

## Programmer's Corner
* Created based on developer feedback to provide a time when we can work and learn together "live"
* We will offer two Programmer's Corner sessions a month for a bit and see how it goes - if they are helpful that's great, if not that's ok, too!
* If this is something that you want to keep doing please add topics you would like to cover in the Discord thread - if we don't see ideas we will take that as an indication that you are not interested in continuing with Programmer's Corner

## Commits

### Fork vs. Clone
* Fork: Independent copy of the git repo
* Clone: Linked copy of the git repo that can update/be updated by the main repo

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone to your local machine
3. Create a new branch
4. Practice going back and forth between your branches
5. Spend ten minutes working on your assigned problem on the new branch
6. Commit your changes to your new branch
7. Merge the new branch
8. Delete the branch

## README Files

## Next Steps
* Finish your assigned problem
* Create a README that explains how to fork, clone, and branch from repos - use README best practices
* Find some time by the end of next week to meet up with another developer and walk them through your code; then work together to refactor your code
